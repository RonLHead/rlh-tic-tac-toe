# Tic-Tac-Toe
This project houses a simple game of tic-tac-toe that can be played on a web browser. The game takes two players (player 1, who plays first, and player 2), and displays a 3 x 3 grid of boxes. On each player's turn they can click on any empty square, which will display their unique token. The game determines the winner when the first player has 3 tokens in a row in any direction (horizontal, vertical, or diagonal). If all boxes are filled but no player has three in a row, the game is a draw.
